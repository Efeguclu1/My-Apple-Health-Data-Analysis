# My-Apple-Health-Data-Analysis
Data Science Project For Sabancı Universtiy CS210


Motivation:
This project was undertaken with the objective of uncovering patterns and correlations between my daily physical activity, measured in steps, and sleep duration. The motivation behind this analysis is to gain insights into my personal health and well-being, with the aim of optimizing my daily routines for better sleep and increased physical activity.

Data Source:
The data for this project were sourced from personal tracking devices that recorded daily step counts and sleep duration over several months. Steps data were collected using an iphone, and sleep duration was tracked using my iphone . The time range for the collected data spans from [start date] to [end date]. To convert the xml file to csv files i used a parser script which i found from the github here you can check: https://github.com/vinayakgaur/Apple-Health-Data-Analysis/blob/main/apple-health-data-parser.py

Key Findings:
A 31-day rolling average revealed seasonal trends in step counts, with peaks during summer and winter, and a dip in spring.
Analysis by day of the week indicated lower activity levels during weekends compared to weekdays.
Sleep duration analysis showed a decline in sleep hours starting in October, suggesting an impact of academic responsibilities on sleep.
The distribution of sleep duration highlighted a skew towards shorter sleep times, with outliers indicating occasional nights of significantly reduced sleep.

Limitations:
The data are self-reported and subject to the accuracy of the tracking devices used.
External factors influencing sleep and activity levels, such as stress and weather, were not directly measured.
The analysis does not account for possible changes in routine or the impact of specific one-off events.

Future Work:
To build upon the findings of this project, future work could include:
Expanding the dataset to cover multiple years for more robust seasonal analysis.
Integrating additional data sources to correlate with external factors like weather conditions and work/school schedules.
Conducting a more detailed time series analysis to predict future trends in sleep and activity levels.
Exploring interventions to improve sleep quality and increase daily step counts based on the patterns observed.
